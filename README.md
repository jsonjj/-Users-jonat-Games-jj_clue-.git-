# Clue Solver & Online Clue Prototype

The **Clue Solver** is a passion project built to enhance the classic board game Clue by introducing computational logic and online gameplay.

At its core, the solver assists players by **tracking cards, analyzing known information, and deducing the winning combination (suspect, weapon, and room) as fast as possible.** This allows the program to act as a partner alongside a player, speeding up deductions and helping them win.

The long-term vision of this project is to develop a **fully independent AI agent** — potentially powered by neural networks — that can play Clue autonomously against human players.

In addition, the project includes an **online prototype of Clue**, built with a local server and browser-based interface, enabling multiplayer play beyond the physical board game.
